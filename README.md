# Python-Django

<h2>Classical Music</h2>
<p>A <strong>Python</strong> web app to keep track of classical cd's, compositions, and musicians in a relational database. The app utilized <strong>Django</strong>, a <strong>MVT Framework</strong> for full CRUD functionality to a <strong>SQL</strong> database. I used <strong>Bootstrap 4</strong> for the front end. I utilized an API of MusicBrainz.com and web scraping (<strong>Beautiful Soup</strong>) to retrieve information that the user can add to the database. I created a <strong>REST API</strong> to connect to the database.</p>
